# Idea 1
- Make the charts to be on the overview page. Users should be able to switch between "Budget", "Income", and "Expenses" to view which one they want. After that, they can choose if they want to view the data visuals in 'pie chart' or 'bar chart' format.
- When user logs in, their email/username should appear on the dashboard (e.g., Welcome Juliet)
- There should be a budget limit amount at the top, that will be set by users (collection can be created for this in the strapi admin panel). Budget categories amount totals must not be more than the budget limit amount set. Else the receive an error message saying "You've exceeded the budget limit for this month"
